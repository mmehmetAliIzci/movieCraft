## Movie crafting weekend project

Pull movies and show it in a nice layout.

### How to run

`yarn install` or `npm install`

`cd ios && pod install`

`npm run start`

`npm run ios`

### Possible Improvements

- Write detox tests
- Write snapshot tests
- Use Fastimage to cache the images
- Implement cache to not request the movies all the time
- More screens ? (Movie detail)

### What did i learned

- Mobx now requires `makeObservable(this);` to send updates to observing components.
- `Pressable` style can get `pressed` as a prop which can be utilized for interactions, even texts but typings are a tough one to crack. Thus ts-ignore :(
- Mocking fetch is cool ‚úîÔ∏è
- In order to use ts in jest of course you need to use `ts-jest` ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
- Since react native uses "density independent pixel", we need to normalize the font sizes.
